# Blocky Code

This is a game that I made in my Year 12 Digital Technologies Class
It was my final project for that year. 

The aim was to create a gameafied coding learning experience for children.

Unfortunately - I appear to have lost the source code, I still have the executable.
You would need gamemaker2 to view the source code anyways. 

Also included is the folio with details about how it was made and an essay on the impact of increased technology usage on children.
