# Blocky Code

This is a game that I made in my Year 12 Digital Technologies Class
It was my final project for that year. 

The aim was to create a gameafied coding learning experience for children.

You probably need GamemakerStudio2 to view the code - You can run the executable though.

Also included is the folio with details about how it was made and an essay on the impact of increased technology usage on children.
