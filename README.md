# Blocky Code

This is a game that I made in my Year 12 Digital Technologies Class
It was my final project for that year. 

The aim was to create a gameafied coding learning experience for children.

You probably need GamemakerStudio2 to view the code - You can run the executable though.
There is also the possibility that that is an old, broken, version of the source code.
As I no longer have access to Gamemaker Studio 2 and cannot confirm it is correct.

Also included is the folio with details about how it was made and an essay on the impact of increased technology usage on children.


Note that I did not create all of the art used in this game.
